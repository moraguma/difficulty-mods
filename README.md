A set of adjustable difficulty options for CrossCode. You can change them at any time from the Assists menu, so mess with it depending on how you're feeling at the moment to get it just right!

- **Received Damage** - already available as a New Game Plus option, but this means you don't have to commit for a whole run, and it's more granular.
- **Enemy HP** - feel like things die too quick when you're fully-equipped? Try this! It affects their break meter too.
- **Enemy Speed** - changes how often enemies attack, and how quick they recover from stun and break status.
- **Healing** - affects all in-combat healing, including sandwiches, regen, and even Arena between-round heals.
- **EXP Gain** - useful for 100% runs so you don't get too overpowered from the sidequests.

All of these options can be turned in the other direction too to make things easier, in addition to the game's normal assist options. Because sometimes you just wanna get 1.5x EXP and not deal with bosses recovering from stun with 2% HP left until the next phase...

### Installation

To use, install [ccloader](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader), and go to the "Mods" menu ingame (the button at the *top* of the Options menu, not the tab on the right) and it should be listed there to select and install.

You can also install manually by placing [the .ccmod file](https://github.com/Azure-Lazuline/difficulty-mods/releases) in your ccloader mods folder.
